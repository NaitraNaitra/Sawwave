# Sawwave
simple commandline sound game writing a saw wave to the DAC and you guess the note

This simple saw wave generator uses the portaudio cross platform library It will then ask you to input the note and tell you if you are correct or incorrect.

In future I would like to point to each function and get the function to read the pitches of a struct containing the tuning offset, however i cannot write to the function without breaking the code (would love some feedback).

First install the portaudio library, then use the makefile to create a commandline tool
